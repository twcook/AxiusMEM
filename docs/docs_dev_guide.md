Use markdown sources and the Sphinx + Read the Docs + GitHub Actions stack.

### Core Principles of Leading-Edge Documentation

1.  **Comprehensive & Structured:** Beyond just API references, good documentation includes:
    * **Clear README.md:** The first impression, covering purpose, installation, quick start, and links to full docs.
    * **Installation Guide:** Detailed steps for different environments.
    * **Getting Started/Quickstart:** Minimal example to show immediate value.
    * **User Guides/Tutorials:** Step-by-step instructions for common use cases.
    * **API Reference:** Automatically generated from docstrings.
    * **Conceptual Overviews:** Explaining the underlying architecture, design choices (like your core ontology, bi-temporal model).
    * **Contributing Guide:** How others can contribute code, documentation, or report issues.
    * **Changelog/Release Notes:** What's new in each version.
    * **FAQ/Troubleshooting:** Common problems and solutions.
2.  **Automated Generation:** Reduce manual effort and ensure consistency. API documentation should be generated directly from code docstrings.
3.  **Versioned Documentation:** Users can easily access docs for the specific version of the library they are using.
4.  **Searchable:** Users can quickly find what they need.
5.  **Accessible:** Easy to read, navigate, and usable by everyone.
6.  **Integrated with CI/CD:** Documentation builds and deployments are automated upon code changes.
7.  **Examples & Code Snippets:** Practical, runnable examples are crucial for adoption.
8.  **Visuals:** Diagrams, flowcharts, and screenshots can greatly enhance understanding, especially for complex systems like knowledge graphs.

### Leading-Edge Tools & Technologies

For Python libraries, the dominant and most powerful stack is:

1.  **Sphinx (with reStructuredText or Markdown via MyST-Parser)**
    * **What it is:** The de-facto standard for generating comprehensive documentation for Python projects. It's a powerful static site generator.
    * **Key Strengths:**
        * **API Documentation:** Excellent `sphinx.ext.autodoc` extension for automatically generating API reference from Python docstrings.
        * **Cross-referencing:** Superb capabilities for linking between different parts of your documentation, including code objects, sections, and external resources.
        * **Extensibility:** A rich ecosystem of extensions for various needs (e.g., `sphinx.ext.napoleon` for Google/NumPy style docstrings, `sphinx_rtd_theme` for a clean theme).
        * **Output Formats:** Generates HTML, PDF, ePub, and more.
        * **Semantic Web Relevance:** While not directly for generating RDF, Sphinx can be used to document complex ontologies and their relationships effectively.
    * **Why for AxiusMEM:** Given AxiusMEM's complexity (ontology, bi-temporality, GraphDB integration), Sphinx's power for detailed API docs, conceptual explanations, and cross-referencing is invaluable.

2.  **Read the Docs (RTD)**
    * **What it is:** The most popular free documentation hosting service for open-source projects. It integrates seamlessly with GitHub.
    * **Key Strengths:**
        * **Automated Builds:** Automatically builds your Sphinx (or MkDocs) documentation whenever you push to your GitHub repository.
        * **Version Management:** Automatically generates and hosts documentation for different branches (e.g., `main`, `dev`) and tags (e.g., `v1.0`, `v1.1`), allowing users to select the docs for their specific library version.
        * **Search:** Provides built-in search functionality across your documentation.
        * **Custom Domains:** Supports custom domain names.
        * **Community Standard:** Widely recognized and trusted.
    * **Why for AxiusMEM:** Essential for hosting, versioning, and automating the deployment of your Sphinx-generated docs.

3.  **Docstring Styles (Google/NumPy Style)**
    * **What it is:** Standardized formats for writing docstrings within your Python code.
    * **Key Strengths:**
        * **Readability:** Easy for humans to read.
        * **Parsable:** Easily parsed by Sphinx's `autodoc` and `napoleon` extensions to generate structured API documentation (parameters, return types, examples).
        * **Consistency:** Encourages consistent in-code documentation.
    * **Why for AxiusMEM:** Crucial for generating high-quality, automated API documentation that is consistent and easy to understand.

4.  **GitHub Pages (for simpler projects or specific sections)**
    * **What it is:** A free service from GitHub to host static websites directly from a GitHub repository.
    * **Key Strengths:** Simple to set up for basic static sites.
    * **Why for AxiusMEM (Limited Use):** While Read the Docs is preferred for the main documentation, GitHub Pages might be used for a very simple project landing page, or if you opt for MkDocs (see below) instead of Sphinx and want direct GitHub integration.

5.  **MkDocs (as an alternative or complement to Sphinx)**
    * **What it is:** A static site generator that uses Markdown for documentation.
    * **Key Strengths:**
        * **Simplicity:** Easier to get started with than Sphinx if you're comfortable with Markdown.
        * **Markdown-centric:** If your team prefers writing in Markdown, MkDocs is a strong contender.
        * **Themes:** Offers modern, responsive themes (like `Material for MkDocs`).
    * **Limitations:** Less powerful for complex API documentation generation compared to Sphinx, especially for intricate Python objects and cross-referencing.
    * **Why for AxiusMEM (Consideration):** While Sphinx is generally recommended for libraries of this complexity, if the primary documentation is conceptual guides and tutorials, and API docs are a secondary concern, MkDocs could be considered for its simplicity. However, for AxiusMEM's deep technical nature, Sphinx is likely better.

6.  **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) with GitHub Actions**
    * **What it is:** Automating the build and deployment of your documentation.
    * **Key Strengths:**
        * **Always Up-to-Date:** Docs are automatically rebuilt and deployed whenever code changes, ensuring they never go stale.
        * **Quality Control:** You can include linting or docstring coverage checks in your CI pipeline.
    * **Why for AxiusMEM:** Essential for ensuring your documentation remains current and high-quality with minimal manual intervention.

### Recommended Stack for AxiusMEM

For a library like AxiusMEM, which deals with complex concepts (ontologies, temporal models, GraphDB integration) and requires detailed API documentation, the **Sphinx + Read the Docs + GitHub Actions** stack is the leading-edge recommendation:

1.  **In-code Documentation:** Use **Google or NumPy style docstrings** for all modules, classes, methods, and functions. Include examples where appropriate.
2.  **Documentation Generator:** Use **Sphinx** to build the documentation.
    * Configure `sphinx.ext.autodoc` to pull in your docstrings for API reference.
    * Use `sphinx.ext.napoleon` to correctly parse Google/NumPy style docstrings.
    * Consider `MyST-Parser` if you prefer writing some conceptual guides in Markdown within Sphinx.
    * Utilize `sphinx.ext.graphviz` or similar extensions if you need to render diagrams (e.g., for ontology structure, data flow).
3.  **Hosting:** Host on **Read the Docs** for automated builds, versioning, and search.
4.  **Automation:** Set up **GitHub Actions** workflows to:
    * Run Sphinx builds on pushes to `main` and `develop` branches.
    * Trigger Read the Docs builds.
    * Potentially run docstring coverage checks or linting.
5.  **Repository Structure:**
    * `README.md`: High-level overview, quick installation, link to full docs.
    * `docs/`: Directory containing all Sphinx source files (`.rst` or `.md`), `conf.py`, `index.rst`, etc.
    * `CONTRIBUTING.md`: Guidelines for contributors.
    * `CHANGELOG.md`: Manual or auto-generated release notes.

This combination provides the power, automation, and user-friendliness needed for a sophisticated library like AxiusMEM to have truly leading-edge documentation.
