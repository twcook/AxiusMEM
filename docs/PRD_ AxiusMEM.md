### **1\. Introduction**

This document outlines the requirements for **AxiusMEM**, a Python library designed to facilitate the creation, management, and querying of dynamic, temporal knowledge graphs for AI agents. Unlike traditional static knowledge bases, AxiusMEM will enable AI agents to operate within continuously evolving environments by providing robust mechanisms for incremental data integration, historical context preservation, and advanced querying capabilities. A key differentiator of AxiusMEM is its strict adherence to **W3C semantic web standards (RDF, SPARQL, OWL)** and initial optimization for **Ontotext GraphDB** as the primary triplestore.

### **2\. Goals & Objectives**

* **Primary Goal:** To empower AI agents with a dynamic, W3C-compliant knowledge base that supports temporal reasoning and continuous learning from evolving data.

* **Objective 2: Temporal Capabilities:** Implement a robust **bi-temporal data model** to track both valid time (when an event occurred) and transaction time (when the information was recorded).  
* **Objective 3: Incremental Data Integration:** Provide efficient mechanisms for continuously integrating new and updated information into the knowledge graph without requiring full re-computation.  
* **Objective 4: Advanced Querying:** Offer flexible and powerful querying capabilities, combining semantic, graph traversal, and temporal dimensions.

This implies a clear separation of concerns between core logic and triplestore-specific adapters.

### **7\. Technical Architecture (High-Level)**

* **Core Layer:** Handles RDF model manipulation, temporal logic, and ontology processing (using rdflib internally or similar).  
* **GraphDB Adapter Layer:** Specific implementations for connecting to and interacting with Ontotext GraphDB via its REST API (e.g., using requests or graphdb-python). This layer will translate high-level AxiusMEM operations into optimized SPARQL queries and GraphDB API calls.  
* **Query Engine:** Responsible for constructing complex SPARQL queries, combining temporal, semantic, and full-text search components.  
* **ORM/Mapper Layer:** Provides convenience methods for mapping Python objects to RDF graphs and vice-versa, making it easier for developers to interact with the graph without deep RDF knowledge for simple cases.  
* **Agent Utility Layer:** High-level functions tailored for common AI agent use cases (e.g., "get context for X," "store agent memory Y").

---

### **8\. Out of Scope**

* A standalone UI for graph visualization (though compatibility with existing tools like GraphDB Workbench or SemSpect is desirable).  
* Built-in capabilities for external data source connectors (e.g., direct SQL database integration), though the library should be extensible to allow users to build such connectors externally.  
* Complex, domain-specific AI reasoning engines (AxiusMEM provides the knowledge base; the agent implements the reasoning).

---

### **9\. Future Considerations (Phased Approach)**

* **Support for other W3C-compliant triplestores:** After solidifying GraphDB integration, explore adapters for other popular triplestores.  
* **Stream processing integration:** Connect directly with real-time data streams (e.g., Kafka) for continuous ingestion.  
* **Advanced temporal analytics:** More sophisticated temporal pattern detection and forecasting.  
* **Integration with specific AI frameworks:** Deeper integration with popular LLM frameworks (e.g., LangChain, LlamaIndex).  
* **Security features:** Fine-grained access control within the library, beyond what GraphDB provides.

---

### **10\. Metrics for Success**

* **Adoption Rate:** Number of active projects and users.  
* **Performance Benchmarks:** Meeting or exceeding NFR performance targets.  
* **Bug Reports:** Low incidence of critical bugs.  
* **Documentation Quality:** Positive user feedback on documentation and examples.  
* **Community Engagement:** Active community participation (e.g., GitHub issues, discussions).  
* **W3C Compliance:** Successful validation against key RDF/SPARQL/OWL conformance tests.

---

### **11\. Open Questions**

* What specific RDF reification or named graph strategies will be used for the bi-temporal model? (This will need detailed design).  
* What level of abstraction is desired for the ORM-like layer? How much RDF detail should be exposed?  
* How will semantic search integrate with GraphDB's native capabilities vs. external embedding models?  
* What are the exact performance benchmarks needed for initial release?  
* What is the strategy for handling schema evolution in production?
