Adapters
========

AxiusMEMâ„¢ provides a unified interface for triplestore integration via the `BaseTriplestoreAdapter` abstract base class. All concrete adapters inherit from this base class and implement the required methods for SPARQL queries, updates, bulk loading, transactions, and named graph management (where supported).

**Adapter Factory:**

The recommended way to instantiate an adapter is via the factory function:

.. code-block:: python

   from axiusmem.adapters.base import get_triplestore_adapter_from_env
   adapter = get_triplestore_adapter_from_env()

This will automatically select and configure the correct adapter based on environment variables (see each adapter's documentation for details).
